## Initializing npm and node_modules using yarn

From project directory cd into `/b2bfintechs24`.
Then use [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) to init node_modules with all the dependenicies listed inside package.json using `yarn install`. It's the same as npm with a faster build time. Any package you would install with `npm install` is done with `yarn add`.
